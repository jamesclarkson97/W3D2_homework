# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?
<!-- We call for new instances in the console.rb file, which uses the code in our property.rb file -->

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?
<!-- In the .sql file -->

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?
<!-- property.update() -->

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
<!-- To prevent duplicates of id, making it harder to navigate and identify later on -->

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?
<!-- In the .sql file, they are auto created when initialised -->

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?
<!-- to ensure that there is not an id, so one can be assigned when the instance is saved -->

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
<!-- some need to only apply to specific instances, and others (like delete all) should apply to all in the class -->

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
<!-- array. Accessing the relevent hash in the array and entering the id keyword (then turining it into an integer usually)  -->

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?
<!-- As we are writing in Ruby, it is important that it translates into SQL -->

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

Q11. What are their return values?
